    <img src="hario.jpg" alt="Pour Over Coffee" width="600" height="400">
    <p>Have you ever wanted to try pour over coffee at home, but had too much respect for your time and money?</P>
    <p>Now that you have nothing better to do, come, wade with me into a warm cup of coffee snobbery.</p>
    <h2>What you'll need...</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Gooseneck Kettle</li>
        <li>Kitchen Scale</li>
        <li>Timer</li>
        <li>Hario V60 dripper</li>
        <li>Hario V60 filter</li>
        <li>Coffee Mug</li>
        <li>17g of medium-fine ground coffee</li>
        <li>250ml of water, 30-45 seconds off boil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What to do...</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a filter into the dripper and place the dripper onto the mug.</li>
        <li>Pour some hot water through the filter to rinse it, as well as to warm the mug. Discard the water.</li>
        <li>Put the coffee into the dripper, level it off, and use your finger to make a small indentation in the grounds.</li>
        <li>Place the dripper and mug onto the kitchen scale.</li>
        <li>Start the timer and pour water over the grounds in a counterclockwise motion until the scale reads 35g.</li>
        <li>After 30 seconds, pour more water until the scale reads 120g.</li>
        <li>Once the water has drained through the dripper, make one last pour until the scale reads 250g.</li>
        <li>Your brew should be complete in 2:30-3:00 minutes.</li>  
    </ol>
